# Software Requirements Specification

A **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** is a technical document that defines what a software product must do and
how it must be developed. It outlines the application’s functionality, features, design constraints, limitations, and
overall goals.

The SRS serves two primary purposes:

* **For clients** it defines expectations, deliverables, and scope.
* **For developers** it guides planning, effort estimation, technology stack selection, and project costing.

The structure and depth of an SRS can vary depending on project complexity and development methodology. However, all
well-formed SRS documents typically include the following elements.

## Purpose

A clear and concise statement defining the intent of the software. It outlines what the system must achieve once
completed and what problem it solves.

## Product Description

The definition of the system's expected behavior, including:

* The intended users
* The operational environment (e.g., web, mobile, desktop)
* Assumptions and constraints that may affect development or operation

## Functional Requirements

Definition of the system's required behavior — what the system must do in response to specific inputs or conditions.
Typically expressed as:
`The system shall <perform a function>.`

## Non-Functional Requirements

Definition of the system's required qualities — such as performance, reliability, scalability, usability, and security.
Typically expressed as:
`The system shall <meet a quality requirement>.`

## User Stories

A structured way to describe expected system behavior from the user's perspective. Each story includes:

* **Title** – A concise description of the feature or capability
* **Narrative** – `As a <type of user>, I want <some goal>, so that <some reason>`
* **Acceptance Criteria** –
  Scenarios written in Gherkin syntax, using:

    * *Given* (initial state)
    * *When* (triggering event or action)
    * *Then* (expected result)

## Test Cases

Used to verify that a specific function or feature of the software behaves as required. Follows the **AAA pattern**:

* **Arrange** – Set up the necessary data and environment
* **Act** – Execute the function or feature being tested
* **Assert** – Check that the result matches the expected outcome
