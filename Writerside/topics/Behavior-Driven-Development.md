# Behavior-Driven Development

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is an Agile software development methodology that promotes collaboration between
business stakeholders, developers, and testers to ensure the software meets user needs. BDD emphasizes defining system
behavior through examples written in a shared, human-readable format.

## Key Principles

- Define behavior through **collaborative conversations**
- Use a **shared language** (often Gherkin) to write scenarios
- Treat these scenarios as **living documentation** and **automated tests**

## Typical BDD Process

1. **Collaborative Specification**. Stakeholders (e.g., product owners, developers, testers) discuss expected behaviors
   using real examples and write scenarios in Gherkin format.
2. **Automated Acceptance Testing**. Scenarios are automated using tools such as Cucumber and are integrated into the CI
   pipeline for continuous verification.
3. **Development**. Developers implement features defined in scenarios. Automated tests are run frequently to ensure
   behavior remains consistent and regressions are caught early.
4. **Review and Feedback**. Each iteration concludes with a stakeholder review. Scenarios may be updated to reflect
   changes or new understanding.
5. **Repeat**. The cycle continues in later iterations.

BDD integrates naturally with Scrum or other Agile frameworks.
